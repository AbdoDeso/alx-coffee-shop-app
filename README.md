# ALX Coffee Shop App

This project, the ALX Coffee Shop App, is a mobile application designed to showcase my skills in front-end development, specifically focusing on building a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface for a coffee shop. The application includes several screens to guide users through the process of Browse products, placing orders, and managing their profile.

## ðŸš€ Building the Screens

The application is built with a focus on a clean, intuitive user experience. The screens were developed based on a provided design, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation and consistent branding.

### Implemented Screens:

-   **Splash Screen:** The initial screen that displays the app's logo and loads any necessary data before the user can interact with the main interface.
-   **Home Screen:** The main landing page where users can view a list of coffee products, featured items, and navigate to other parts of the app.
-   **Product Detail Screen:** A dedicated screen for each coffee product, showing a detailed description, price, and options for customization (e.g., size, milk type).
-   **Cart Screen:** Displays the user's selected items, allowing them to review their order, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
-   **Checkout Screen:** The final step for placing an order, where users can enter their payment and delivery information.
-   **Order History Screen:** A section where users can view their past orders.
-   **Profile Screen:** A personal space for users to manage their account details and settings.

## ðŸš§ Challenges and Solutions

Building the application presented several challenges that required careful problem-solving and a deep understanding of front-end development principles.

-   **Challenge: Achieving Pixel-Perfect Design:**
    -   **Problem:** Translating a static design into a dynamic, responsive user interface is often challenging. Small inconsistencies in padding, margin, and font sizes can make the app feel unpolished.
    -   **Solution:** I used a component-based approach, creating reusable UI elements for buttons, cards, and text styles. This ensured consistency across all screens. I also relied on a combination of flexbox and grid layouts to maintain the correct spacing and alignment regardless of screen size.

-   **Challenge: State Management:**
    -   **Problem:** Managing the state of the user's cartâ€”adding items, updating quantities, and calculating the total priceâ€”required a robust state management solution to prevent data inconsistencies.
    -   **Solution:** I implemented a centralized state management pattern to handle all cart-related logic. This allowed me to update the cart from any screen and have the changes reflect immediately across the entire application, such as on the cart icon badge.

-   **Challenge: Performance Optimization:**
    -   **Problem:** A large number of product images and interactive elements can lead to slow loading times and a sluggish user experience.
    -   **Solution:** I optimized image loading by using lazy loading techniques, ensuring that images are only loaded when they are about to be displayed on the screen. Additionally, I minimized re-renders by using performance hooks and memoization to prevent unnecessary component updates, making the app feel fast and responsive.
